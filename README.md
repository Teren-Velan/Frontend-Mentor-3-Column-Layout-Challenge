## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this 3-column preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

## Reflection

Through this project i was able to practice building layouts and also practice making it responsive, initially I used flexbox for my columns , but since grid was what i was weaker at i decided to use grid instead. Overall i got a better understanding of grid and how to use it to create responsive layouts.

## Lastly

This is my 3rd frontend mentor challenge , stay tuned as i will be attempting more and posting them up here, feel free to fork the repo and check out the code. Your feedback would be greatly appreciated.

Cheers!
